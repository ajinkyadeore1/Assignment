    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation: It is the process of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world and providing a public interface for accessing the object's attributes and methods. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction, data hiding, and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Inheritance: It is the process of creating a new class from an existing class by inheriting its attributes and methods. The new class is called a subclass or derived class, and the existing class is called a superclass or base class. Inheritance helps in achieving code reusability, and it also allows us to create specialized versions of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Polymorphism: It is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding is when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass. Method overloading is when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Abstraction: It is the process of reducing complexity by hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features of an object. Abstraction helps in achieving data hiding and modularity. In Python, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.'''"
